Summary:
In this summer, I work on two sub-projects for RTEMS Project:
1. RTEMS Release Notes Generator (ticket: #3314)
Ticket‚Äôs link: https://devel.rtems.org/ticket/3314
Check all the code for this project in this Github repository:
https://github.com/dh0072/ReleaseNotesGenerator
Introduction: This project aims to automatically create the RTEMS release notes for a release from the Trac data by using XML parser (Python). Since all changes on a release branch must have a ticket, the ticket is assigned the Version and Milestone. Therefore, web pages are converted to a PDF as the release notes.


2. RTEMS POSIX User Guide Generator (ticket: #3333)
Ticket‚Äôs link: https://devel.rtems.org/ticket/3333
Check all the code for this project in this Github repository:
https://github.com/dh0072/NewlibMarkup2SphinxConverter
Patch‚Äôs link: https://github.com/dh0072/GSoC2018GithubIO/blob/master/makedoc2rst_patch.md
Introduction: RTEMS uses the Newlib C Library for a significant portion of its POSIX support. Currently, the RTEMS POSIX Users Guide will not provide documentation for a method not based on Newlib's. Therefore, this project aims to automatically convert Newlib markup to Sphinx output and integrate with POSIX users guide. 


Details:
First project: RTEMS POSIX User Guide Generator (ticket: #3333)
Completed tasks:
1. Provided a command ‚Äúpython2 release_notes.py --milestone_id XXX‚Äù to directly generate a release notes in Markdown format from Trac
2. Generated Markdown version of release notes ‚Äútickets.md‚Äù
3. Created a python class ‚Äúunicode_dict_reader.py‚Äù to make the program be compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 
4. Created a Python class ‚Äútickets.py‚Äù to get all needed data from a ticket‚Äôs page and a milestone‚Äôs page
5. Created a Python class ‚Äúmarkdown.py‚Äù to limit max column width to 20 characters and max number of columns to 4. Therefore, release notes can fit into A4 size.
6. Fetched needed information by parsing XML page
7. Calculated the tickets‚Äô statistics for the given milestone


Second project: RTEMS POSIX User Guide Generator (ticket: #3333)
Completed tasks:
1. Created Command Line Interface (Python argument parser) to specify path of C source file and path of destination rst markup file
2. Provided rst utilities to register commands (FUNCTION, INDEX, SYNOPSYS, etc) and their corresponding processors methods
3. Created class (makedoc2rst) to parse C-style block comments with makedoc format in C source file with Regular Expression matching
4. Extracted commands and its corresponding text in C source file
5. Generated rst markup based on command type and save it to destination rst file


Though it is almost the end of GSoC project, I will keep an eye out for any feature requests bug fixes related to them. I believe it is one of the sprits of open source project ‚Äì keep making contribution to the project and always maintain the code!


I am grateful to meet my mentors! Thanks to their professionalism, patience and passion, so I can finish these projects under their supervisions and have such a fruitful summer! üòä
